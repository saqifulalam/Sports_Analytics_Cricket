A simple project showing what we can do with cricket ball by ball data

The data is from T20 Matches, and I have narrowed it down to Bangladesh, and the for those balls where Shakib Al Hasan is striker. This is just a fun personal project, but can give you an idea of the depth we can analyze cricket ball by ball data to help our criketing team!
